#Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic tac toe game. Players alternate turns and try to get three in a row. Good luck!!

Player X will go first. They will choose one square by clicking the box. It will then be player O's turn. They will choose, then back and forth until either player gets three of their letters, in a row. A row can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. 

The game will let you know if either player wins, or if there are no more squares open, and no winner, which results in a tie game. 

You can press the "Start new game" button to clear the board and start a new game whenever you want.
